# AgeCalculator

AgeCalculator is a simple and user-friendly application designed to calculate your age based on your date of birth. The application takes input for the day, month, and year, and then calculates the exact age in years, months, and days.

## Features

- **Age Calculation**: Provides the age in years, months, and days based on the entered birthdate.

## Technologies Used

- **Avalonia UI**: A cross-platform framework used to build the desktop application.
- **C#**: The primary programming language for backend logic.
- **MVVM**: The design pattern used for separating the view and business logic.

## How to Use

1. Enter your birthdate in the "Day", "Month", and "Year" input fields.
2. Click the **SUBMIT** button to calculate your age.
3. The result will be displayed below the input fields, showing the number of **years**, **months**, and **days**.
